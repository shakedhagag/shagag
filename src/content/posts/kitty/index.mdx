Over the past month, I transitioned from WezTerm to the Kitty terminal, thanks to a friend's recommendation. After daily use with tmux and Neovim, I can say it's been a game-changer—responsive, fast, and effortlessly configurable.

Kitty leverages the GPU to enhance performance, delivering a smooth and seamless experience:

> The main goals for *kitty* performance are user perceived latency while typing and “smoothness” while scrolling as well as CPU usage. *kitty* tries hard to find an optimum balance for these. To that end it keeps a cache of each rendered glyph in video RAM so that font rendering is not a bottleneck. Interaction with child programs takes place in a separate thread from rendering, to improve smoothness. Parsing of the byte stream is done using [vector CPU instructions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) for maximum performance. Updates to the screen typically require sending just a few bytes to the GPU.

You can check out the performance benchmarks in [Kitty's documentation](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/performance/), and while they certainly look impressive, I had to see it for myself. After using it, I can confirm—it lives up to the hype.

# Configuration

Kitty uses `.conf` files for configurations this is mine:

```zsh
# BEGIN_KITTY_THEME
# Solarized Osaka
include current-theme.conf
# END_KITTY_THEME

font_family FiraCode Nerd Font Mono Light
font_size 16
bold_font        auto
italic_font      auto
bold_italic_font auto


background_opacity 0.8
background_blur 50


macos_show_window_title_in none
macos_titlebar_color #1a1b26
macos_menubar_title_max_length 0
hide_window_decorations titlebar-only

```

I use FiraCode Mono Light font, enabled font ligatures, and added a touch of background opacity with blur for that extra visual appeal, along with a few tailored macOS settings to match my preferences.

## Theme

If you know, you know. Solarized Osaka is a theme inspired by [craftzdog](https://www.craftz.dog/) - Takuya Matsuyama, a talented developer I’ve been following on YouTube and Twitter. I loved his theme’s color scheme so much that I created my own theme file for Kitty, as it’s not available in the default Kitty themes.

```zsh
# vim:ft=kitty

## name: Solarized Osaka
## author: shagag
## license: MIT
## blurb: Precision colors for developers

background #1a1b26
foreground #c0caf5
cursor #c0caf5
selection_background #283457
color0 #002731
color8 #001e26
color1 #d01b24
color9 #bd3612
color2 #728905
color10 #465a61
color3 #a57705
color11 #52676f
color4 #2075c7
color12 #708183
color5 #c61b6e
color13 #5856b9
color6 #259185
color14 #81908f
color7 #e9e2cb
color15 #fcf4dc
selection_foreground #93a1a1

```

Simply copy the contents of the file above, and creat a current-theme.conf file inside the kitty `.config` directory. Don't forget to `gnu stow` kitty and add to your github dotfiles repo!
