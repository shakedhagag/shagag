ZSA is a cool library I encountered during my regular morning youtube crawl, and it caught my eye.

I've been working on a quite large project, using nextjs and all the stuff the cool kids use like zod, drizzle etc.
Well, I noticed that creating a server action is a bit tedious when you want end to end type-safety.

I have yet to find an elegant way to validate, execute and make sure everything inside a server action is good, it is always a bit of hassle. Although I have pretty much created a standard of how to do that in my project, I was very happy to see someone abstracted it very good, that's where ZSA comes in to play.

## Installation

```shell
npm i zsa zsa-react zod
```

## Use-Cases

1. Creating a server action: (example from docs)

```typescript
"use server";

import { createServerAction } from "zsa";
import z from "zod";

export const incrementNumberAction = createServerAction()
  .input(
    z.object({
      number: z.number(),
    }),
  )
  .handler(async ({ input }) => {
    // Sleep for .5 seconds
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
    // Increment the input number by 1
    return input.number + 1;
  });
```

In this example, we can notice 3 things: 1. createServerAction - this function initializes the server action. 2. input - this is the input schema for zod to validate 3. handler - the handler function, which gets the validated input and performs the action.

2. Calling an action from the server:

```typescript file=example.ts
"use server";

const [data, err] = await incrementNumberAction({ number: 24 });

if (err) {
  return;
} else {
  console.log(data); // 25
}
```

This function returns `[data,null]` on success or `[null,err]` on failure.
Apart from the returned array, looks like a regular async function we call from the server right? Don't forget the input validation that happens in the bg.

3. Calling from the client

```typescript filename=increment-example.tsx
<Button
    onClick={async () => {
	    const [data, err] = await incrementNumberAction({
            number: counter,
        })
        if (err) {
        // handle error
        return
        }

		setCounter(data);
  }}
>
    Invoke action
</Button>
```

And with a dedicated hook for loading state ðŸ¤©

```typescript
"use client"

import { incrementNumberAction } from "./actions";
import { useServerAction } from "zsa-react";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Button, Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "ui";

export default function IncrementExample() {
    const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
    const { isPending, execute, data } = useServerAction(incrementNumberAction);

    return (
        <Card>
            <CardHeader>
                <CardTitle>Increment Number</CardTitle>
            </CardHeader>
            <CardContent className="flex flex-col gap-4">
                <Button
                    disabled={isPending}
                    onClick={async () => {
                        const [data, err] = await execute({
                            number: counter,
                        })

                        if (err) {
                            // handle error
                            return
                        }

                        setCounter(data);
                    }}
                >
                    Invoke action
                </Button>
                <p>Count:</p>
                <div>{isPending ? "saving..." : data}</div>
            </CardContent>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

How awesome is that right?

## Procedures

There are also what ZSA calls "procedures":

> Procedures allow you to add additional context to a set of server actions, such as theÂ `userId`Â of the caller. They are useful for ensuring certain actions can only be called if specific conditions are met, like the user being logged in or having certain permissions.

e.g:

```typescript
"use server";
import { createServerActionProcedure } from "zsa";

const authedProcedure = createServerActionProcedure().handler(async () => {
  try {
    const { email, id } = await getUser();

    return {
      user: {
        email,
        id,
      },
    };
  } catch {
    throw new Error("User not authenticated");
  }
});

export const updateEmail = authedProcedure
  .createServerAction()
  .input(
    z.object({
      newEmail: z.string(),
    }),
  )
  .handler(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
    const { user } = ctx;

    // Update user's email in the database
    await db
      .update(users)
      .set({
        email: newEmail,
      })
      .where(eq(users.id, user.id));

    return input.newEmail;
  });
```

In this example we create a procedure called `authedProcedure` which returns a `user` object, and in the `updateEmail` function we chain a server action to that procedure thus we are able to get a `ctx` (context) object, and retrieve the information of the user. This is basically like creating a middleware.

## Outputs

We can also define outputs, using the same validation library, zod.

```typescript
"use server";

import { createServerAction } from "zsa";
import z from "zod";

export const myOutputAction = createServerAction()
  .input(
    z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      email: z.string().email(),
    }),
  )
  .output(
    z.object({
      message: z.string(),
      timestamp: z.date(),
    }),
  )
  .handler(async ({ input }) => {
    // Process the input data and create a response
    return {
      message: `Hello, ${input.name}! Your email is ${input.email}.`,
      timestamp: new Date(),
    };
  });
```

Notice we are now chaining the `output` handler to the server action constructor, this ensures that the object we return has the expected types!
This is super awesome since trying to create sort of a standard of server actions and validation myself, was not clean and good enough.

## Conclusions

There are also sections in the docs about callbacks, timeouts, retries and error handling but I thought this article is big enough and covers a bit more than the basic stuff zsa has to offer.
I'm now migrating my server actions to zsa actions and procedures and I'm loving it, it creates order and makes the code much cleaner.
