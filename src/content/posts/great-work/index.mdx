## How to Do Great Work

I just finished reading an essay that was sent to me by a friend - [HTDGW](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html). 
This essay was written by Paul Graham, a very interesting persona overall, and specifically the co-founder of [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/).
Paul is also a Doctor of Philosophy apart from his Masters in Computer Science, two fields I've always admired, but never thought they can go together. :grimacing: 

So I open the link, and aside from getting sunburn from this light mode ugly website (as a dark mode lover), the first line I noticed, right of the bat was line number 9:

> The following recipe assumes you're very ambitious.

This was an instant trigger to continue and read this huge essay (don't worry I split it to 2 sessions).

## Essay Conclusions

The following points represent my key takeaways from this essay, stuff I like, things I want to remember etc:

---

> **all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in.**

The first section discuss how selecting a career path is often more challenging than it appears. Many people choose their field of study and, consequently, their career based on misguided criteria.
For instance, I pursued Computer Science because I have a genuine passion for it. However, many of my university peers, despite being highly intelligent and capable of completing the degree successfully, have expressed sentiments such as “I don’t even like coding,” “I’m not connected to this field,” or “I’m here for the money.” While these reasons are valid, I believe that lacking passion for one’s chosen field can significantly impede the ability to excel.

>**Don't let "work" mean something other people tell you to do. If you do manage to do great work one day, it will probably be on a project of your own. It may be within some bigger project, but you'll be driving your part of it.**

Can't stress this more, I was first introduced to this concept when I was listening to a [Lex Fridman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lex_Fridman) podcast, about "Deep Work" when I was a student, and sought after ways to improve my efficiency of studying.

**3 Most powerful motives**:
1. Curiosity
2. Delight
3. Desire to do something impressive

---

> **Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do.**

This is precisely what I have experienced. I had a genuine interest in the subject, but Computer Science is such a vast field that it's challenging to determine the specific path to pursue. In my case, the answer was to explore various areas within the field and continue focusing on the ones that I found most enjoyable. By doing this, I could gradually narrow down my interests until I fully committed to a single field.
Keep in mind I also believe luck has a lot to do with it. If you believe in luck (duh.).

The following quote is a great advice for any teenager, or someone who is not sure what to work on. I would love to tell this to my future kids:

>**What should you do if you're young and ambitious but don't know what to work on? What you should not do is drift along passively, assuming the problem will solve itself. You need to take action. But there is no systematic procedure you can follow. When you read biographies of people who've done great work, it's remarkable how much luck is involved. They discover what to work on as a result of a chance meeting, or by reading a book they happen to pick up. So you need to make yourself a big target for luck, and the way to do that is to be curious. Try lots of things, meet lots of people, read lots of books, ask lots of questions.**

---

>**It will probably be harder to start working than to keep working. You'll often have to trick yourself to get over that initial threshold. Don't worry about this; it's the nature of work, not a flaw in your character.**

Can anyone else relate? Sometimes, looking back after working for a long time, I realize that if I hadn’t spent so much time "preparing" to start my work sessions, I could have achieved much more.

---

**Consistency is key.**

>Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're genuinely interested in. When you pause to take stock, you're surprised how far you've come.  
>The reason we're surprised is that we underestimate the cumulative effect of work. Writing a page a day doesn't sound like much, but if you do it every day you'll write a book a year. That's the key: consistency. People who do great things don't get a lot done every day. They get something done, rather than nothing.

The following always reminds me of the famous "walks" Steve Jobs was doing, sometimes you just need to disconnect from everything (most importantly social media) and like [Eckhart Tolle ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckhart_Tolle) preaches, just BE. I often find this very helpful.

>Work doesn't just happen when you're trying to. There's a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you'll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack.

---

>**Have the confidence to cut. Don't keep something that doesn't fit just because you're proud of it, or because it cost you a lot of effort.**

This is also something I often find hard to do, its basically admitting your'e wrong, and that's a hard thing to do unfortunately. 
I want to be better at this.
