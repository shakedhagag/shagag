Here is a cool thing I learned on the internet today, fixing the autocomplete/suggestions feature for a typescript type.

## The Problem

Imagine you're building a car configuration system for a luxury dealership. You want to suggest popular brands but also allow for custom or rare brands. Your first attempt might look like this:

```ts
type LuxuryCar = "Ferrari" | "Porsche" | "Lamborghini";

const car: LuxuryCar = "Bugatti"; // Error! Type '"Bugatti"' is not assignable to type 'LuxuryCar'
```

This is too restrictive. Using a plain string type would solve the flexibility issue but loses the nice autocomplete suggestions:

```ts
type LuxuryCar = string;

const car: LuxuryCar = "anything"; // Works, but no autocomplete suggestions
```

## The Solution

Here's where TypeScript's type system shows its power. We can create a type that both suggests specific values AND allows any string using a clever intersection type:

```ts
type AutoComplete<T extends string> = T | (string & {});

type LuxuryCar = AutoComplete<"Ferrari" | "Porsche" | "Lamborghini">;

const valid: LuxuryCar = "Pagani"; // ✅ Works fine
const suggested: LuxuryCar = "Ferrari"; // ✅ Gets autocomplete suggestions!
```

## How does it work?

The magic happens through several TypeScript mechanisms working together:

### Type Intersection with Empty Object

`string & {}`

When you intersect string with `{}`, you get a type that is assignable to string but cannot be undefined or null.
And That's the magic right there, an empty object does not represent the empty object type! It represents any non-nullable value.
So `string & {}` actually represents all strings that are not null or undefined.

_A quick explanation about the empty object type
If we want to define an empty object (not sure when you would need it but ok) we can do something like this:_

```ts
type EmptyObject = Record<string, never>;
```

_This is literaly saying empty object - a record type where the keys are strings and the value is never, meaning it cannot exist. the only type that suffices this is `{}`._

### Union with Literal Types

```ts
T | (string & {});
```

This combines our specific literals (T) with the branded string type, creating a type that:

Accepts any string value
Provides autocomplete suggestions for the literal values

### But wait how does that affect the AutoComplete?!

The key insight is about how TypeScript's autocomplete behavior is designed to be helpful to developers. When TypeScript sees a union type, it has specific rules about how it prioritizes suggestions:

When suggesting completions, TypeScript will always show the most specific types first:

```ts
// Case 1: No autocomplete
type NormalUnion = "Ferrari" | "Porsche" | string;

// Case 2: Autocomplete works
type BrandedUnion = "Ferrari" | "Porsche" | (string & {});
```

The key difference lies in how TypeScript's type system handles these unions internally:

In Case 1 (string), TypeScript sees this and immediately widens the entire type to just string.
This is because `"Ferrari" | "Porsche" | string` is equivalent to just string - the literals get absorbed into the more general string type. When this widening happens, TypeScript loses the information about the specific literals, so they don't appear in autocomplete.

In Case 2 (string & {}), TypeScript keeps the union distinct because `string & {}` is seen as a separate "branded" type, even though it represents all strings. The type system doesn't widen or collapse this union, preserving the literal types as distinct options.

### Conclusion

It's about preventing type widening while still allowing all strings - the intersection with `{}` tricks TypeScript into preserving the union structure rather than collapsing it to string.
