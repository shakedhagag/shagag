To obtain user input we need to bring the io library into scope. This lib comes out of the standard library called `std`:

```rust
use std::io
```

by default, rust has a set of items defined in the std that it brings into the scope of every program, these can be found here:
[std::prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html)
and it is called the prelude.

If a type you want to use is not in the prelude, you have to bring that type into scope explicitly with a use statement.

```rust
use std::io;


fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}

```

- `String` - is a string type provided by the standard lib that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.
- The `::` syntax in the `::new` line indicated that new is an associated function of the String type. An "associated function" is a fucntion that's implemented on a type, in this case, String.

> Useful command `cargo doc --open` builds a documentation website that consists of all the packages the project is using.

### Generating a Random Number

```rust
use rand::Rng;

let number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
```

the first line, brings the package to scope, (after adding it to the dependencies under the `cargo.toml` file)

the `Rng` is a [trait](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html).

the second line, consists of several things:

1. `rand::thread_rng()` - this is a function that gives us the particular random generator that is local to the current thread, and seeded by the os.
2. `gen_range` - a method that takes a range expression as an arguemnt and generates a random number in that range.

### Comparing

`use std::cmp::Ordering` - this line brings a type called Ordering into scope from the std lib. Its another enum that has the variants Less, Greater, and Equal.

```rust
match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
	Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!")
	Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!")
	Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!")
}
```

> A match expression is made out of 'arms' an arm consists of a pattern to match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to match each arm's pattern in turn.

    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

this line serves as a shadowing of the guess variable we declared earlier, it takes the guess, trims the whitespace around it and parses it to be a u32 integer. if an error occurs during this process the executable will crash with an error. "Please type a number".
(this means parse, return a Result type, which has 2 variants, Err and Ok)
