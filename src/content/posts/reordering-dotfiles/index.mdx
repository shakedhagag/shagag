I work with too many tools as a software developer. 
I recently moved from vscode to neovim and started configuring my dotfiles much more, as neovim requires a whole lot of configurations, choosing the terminal, configuring zshell and much more.

NeoVim opened a door I did not know I wanted to enter, and that made me look for a solution that will sync my dotfiles between machines, and keep them up to date.

## What is GNU Stow?

>GNU Stow is a symlink farm manager which takes distinct packages of software and/or data located in separate directories on the filesystem, and makes them appear to be installed in the same place.

### What is a `symlink` ?

A symlink is a file in unix systems, that acts as a pointer to another location in the file system, this allows us to access files from different location without the need to duplicate any of the files.

### How to create a symlink?

We have the link command: `ln`,  lets check the helper:
```zsh
❯ ln -h
usage: ln [-s [-F] | -L | -P] [-f | -i] [-hnv] source_file [target_file]
       ln [-s [-F] | -L | -P] [-f | -i] [-hnv] source_file ... target_dir
       link source_file target_file
```

Okay, doesn't say much, so we read online.
Turns out the flag we need is `-s` and it specifies a soft link, you can probably guess what it is but anyways:

>**Soft links** are similar to shortcuts, and can point to another file or directory in any file system.
>**Hard links** are also shortcuts for files and folders, but a hard link cannot be created for a folder or file in a different file system. These can be created in the following way on Linux and Mac operating systems.

So we need a soft link, using the link command, -s flag we can create a symlink:

```zsh
ln -s /path/to/file/to/be/linked /path/to/the/link/to/be/created
```

To test this, I created a file named `~/test/hello-world.sh` that contains the following line:
```zsh filename="hello-world.sh"
echo Hello World
```


Using `sh hello-world.sh` runs the echo command and print Hello World in the terminal. Now let's create a symlink:
```zsh
ln -s ~/test/hello-world.sh hello-world.sh
```

Now let's see what we did, simply run the command:
```zsh
ls -l
```

and voila:

```zsh
lrwxr-xr-x 1 staff 51 Jun 22 23:00 hello-world.sh -> ~/test/hello-world.sh
```

The line above means that hello-world.sh is linked to the file we created earlier, test/hello-world.sh. You can also see in far left `l` specifies the link.

The magic here is that you can now edit the link file, and the original will be edited as well! Now you must see how I can use it for dotfiles!

#### Installing GNU Stow

I'm using brew:
```zsh
brew install stow
```

Now lets create the folder that will contain all the dotfiles, and will be committed to github:
```zsh
mkdir ~/.dotfiles
```

This folder will contain all our configuration files. 
`gnu stow` is requiring a special naming convention, as an example, the config files of nvim are located in: `~/.config/nvim` so in the gnu stow folder we need to create a folder: `nvim/.config/nvim`

Another example would be `.zshrc` which is located in the home folder, then in gnu stow, we need to create the following: `zsh/.zshrc`

Now let's start by moving nvim config files, to the new folder. 
```zsh
mv .config/nvim .dotfiles/nvim/.config/
```
Opening nvim now should indicate that you moved every config file successfully, since it should be nvim without any plugin or config you had before, don't worry! let's fix this.
Inside the new dotfiles directory, type:
```zsh 
stow nvim
```
This command creates the symlink to nvim files! because we made sure to handle the naming convention we shouldn't have any problem.
Now going in to .config folder, and typing:
```zsh
ls -l | grep nvim
```
we get `nvim -> ../.dotfiles/nvim/.config/nvim`, this means that nvim folder inside .config is just a symlink to our dotfiles.

### Useful stuff

* If you need to clean a symlink use the following command
  `stow -D`
* When using version control on the .dotfiles folder stow will automatically ignore the .git folder

### Conclusions

1. We installed `gnu stow` 
2. We created a dotfiles folder for all our configurations to live in.
3. We used the naming convention of gnu stow to create sub folders inside .dotfiles.
4. We moved every configuration we use (.zshrc, nvim, wezterm, tmux etc) to the new folder and then used `stow ${package}` to create a symlink.
5. Now all that is left is to create a github repo where every change would be committed and used from any machine!
