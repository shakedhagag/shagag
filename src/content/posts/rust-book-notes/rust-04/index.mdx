Ownership is one of Rust's most unique and important features - a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory. Unlike other programming languages that use garbage collection or manual memory management, Rust uses a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler checks at compile time.

## Core Ownership Rules

- Each value in Rust has an Owner
- There can only be one owner at a time
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

> Important Note: There is a crucial difference between the `&str` (string slice) type and `String` type. A string slice is allocated on the stack and has a fixed, known length, while `String` is allocated on the heap and can grow or shrink at runtime. This is why we use `String` when we need a mutable string:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello"); // Heap-allocated String
let str_slice = "hello";       // Stack-allocated string slice
```

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");

s.push_str(", world!"); // appends a literal to a String
```

## Memory and Allocation

With the String type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text, we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unkown at compile time, to hold the contents.

- The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
- We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we're done with our string

When a variable goes out of scope Rust calls a special function called `drop` which is acting sort of like a garbage collector, by dropping unused memory

<Image src={allocation} alt="allocation example two" />

if we run the following code:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1
```

Only the stack data is duplicated -

<Image src={allocation2} alt="allocation example two" />

- Double free - a bug that is caused by freeing the memory twice

Rust prevents this by default. Notice what happens when we try to print s1 after assigning it to s2

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1

println!("{s1}, world!");

```

We would get an error saying `borrow of moved value: `s1
So we can see that rust does not make shallow copies, but "moves" the value -> s1 was moved to s2

Rust allows us to deeply copy the heap data of the String, not just the stack data with a method called `clone`:

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();

println!("{s1}, world!");
```

But there is a difference when it comes to stack allocated memory:

```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;

println!("{x}, {y}");
```

The above code is completely valid, because stack allocated memory is easy to clone and quick to make.

> Rust has a special annotation called the Copy `trait` that we can place on types that are stored on the stack. If a type implements the copy trait, variables that use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid after assignment to another variable.

## Ownership and functions

Once a value is moved into the function scope, it is no longer valid inside the calling function unless the value is returned:

```rust
fn main(){
	let s = String::from("hello");
	takes_ownership(s) // s's value moves into take_ownership and from here on
	 // is no longer valid, if we tried to use s after this line
	 // we would get an error
}
```

### The Key Takeaway:

**In Rust, assigning a value to another variable moves ownership. When a variable containing heap data goes out of scope, Rust automatically cleans up that memory using `drop` - unless the ownership was moved to another variable.**

This might seem restrictive, but Rust provides a powerful feature to work around this: References and Borrowing. Let's see how they work:

```rust
fn main(){
	let s = String::from("hello");
	let len = calculate_length(&s1);
	println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}");
}

fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // takes a reference to a String
	s.len();
}
```

When functions have references as parameters instead of the actual values we wont need to return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had ownership.

This is called _borrowing_ - the action of creating a reference.
If we try to change the or modify something we are _borrowing_ we would get an error:

```rust
cannot borrow x as mutable, as it is behind a & reference
```

> Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references.

## Mutable References

```rust
fn main(){
	let mut s = String::from("hello");
	change(&mut s);
}

fn change(some_string: &mut String) { // takes a reference to a String
	some_string.push_str(", world");
}
```

We changed s to be a mutable string and the parameter to be a mutable string reference: `&mut String`
This means that the change function will mutate the value it borrows.

**Mutable references have one restriction, if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value.**

**We also cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one to the same value**

## Understanding Slices

_Slices_ are a powerful Rust feature that let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection without taking ownership. They're particularly useful when you want to reference only a portion of a collection, like getting a word from a string or a subset of an array.

```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");
let hello = &s[0..5];

let world = &s[6..11];
```

the slice is a reference to a range of the string s. it is annotated using - [starting_index..ending_index].

The type that signifies "string slice" is written as &str

```rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -< &str {
	let bytes = s.as_bytes(); // returns the string represented in arr of bytes

	for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
	 // enumerate returns (index, ref to item)
		if item == b' ' { // b' ' byte representation of space char
			return &s[0..i]; // returns the first word up until the space
		}
	}
	s[..] // returns the entire string
}
```
