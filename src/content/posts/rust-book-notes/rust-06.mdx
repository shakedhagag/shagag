Enums in Rust provide a powerful way to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. This feature allows for more expressive and type-safe code. Let's explore how to create an enum:

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    v4,
    v6,
}
```

We can instantiate each of the two variants of `IpAddrKind` as follows:

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::v4;
let six = IpAddrKind::v6;
```

Notice that both variables are of the same type, `IpAddrKind`, and are namespaced under it. This allows us to define a function that can accept any `IpAddrKind` variant:

```rust
fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {

}

route(IpAddrKind::v4);
```

Enums in Rust can also hold data directly within each variant, making them versatile and powerful:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
  V4(String),
  V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"))
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"))
```

This approach is both simple and intuitive, as it allows us to attach data directly to each variant of the enum.

- While this can also be achieved using structs, it often results in more verbose and less elegant code:

  ```rust
  struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
  }

  let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
  };
  ```

Let's examine a more complex example:

```rust
enum message {
  quit,
  move { x:i32, y:32 },
  write(string),
  changecolor(i32, i32, i32)
}
```

The same functionality can be achieved using structs, but it requires more boilerplate code:

```rust
struct QuitMessage;
struct MoveMessage {
  x: i32,
  y:i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String);
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32);
```

In this example, we created four different structs to represent what was previously a single enum. This approach is more complex and redundant. Additionally, defining a function to handle any of these message types is not as straightforward as it is with an enum.

We can also define methods on enums using `impl` blocks:

```rust
impl Message {
  fn call(&self) {
    //method body
  }
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
m.call();
```

### The Option Enum

The `Option` enum, defined in the standard library, elegantly handles scenarios where a value might be present or absent. Unlike many other languages, Rust does not have a `null` feature, which often represents the absence of a value. Instead, Rust uses `Option` to explicitly handle such cases.

```rust
enum Option<T> {
  None,
  Some(T)
}
```

The `Option` enum is so fundamental that it is included in the Rust prelude, meaning you don't need to explicitly bring it into scope. The two variants of `Option` are `Some` and `None`.

```rust

let some_number = Some(5);
let absent_number: Option<i32> = None

```

The type of `some_number` is `Option<i32>`. For `absent_number`, Rust requires us to annotate the option type explicitly because it is a `None` value.

### Matches are exhaustive

Rust's `match` expression is exhaustive, meaning that all possible cases must be handled for the code to be valid. This ensures that no potential scenario is overlooked.

### Catch-All Patterns and the `_` Placeholder

The underscore (`_`) is a special pattern in Rust that matches any value without binding it to a variable. It is particularly useful in `match` expressions when you want to handle all remaining cases without needing to use the values.

1. Using `_`:

```rust
match some_value {
    0 => println!("Zero"),
    1 => println!("One"),
    _ => println!("Something else")  // Matches any other number
}
```

2. Using a variable name to catch and bind the value:

```rust
match number {
    1 => println!("One"),
    2 => println!("Two"),
    n => println!("The number is: {}", n)  // Matches and binds the value to 'n'
}
```

Key differences between `_` and a catch-all variable:

- `_` discards the value and cannot be used later
- A named variable (like n) captures the value and lets you use it
- `_` clearly signals to other developers that the value won't be used
