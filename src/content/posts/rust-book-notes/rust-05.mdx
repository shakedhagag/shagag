## Struct -

or a structure is a custom data type that lets you package together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group.

## Defining and instantiating Structs

```rust
struct User {
	active: bool,
	username: String,
	email: String,
	sign_in_count: u64
}

let user1 = User {
	active: true,
	username: String::from("someusername"),
	email: ""'"""",
	sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

Changing and accessing fields:

```rust
let mut user1 = User { // creating an instance of the struct
	active: true,
	username: String::from("someusername"),
	email: "",
	sign_in_count: 1,
};

user1.email = String::from("another-email.."); // since its mutable we can change the fields value
```

### Tuple structs

```rust
struct Color(i32,i32,i32);
struct Point(i32,i32,i32);
```

Color and Point are different types, and cannot take each other as arguments.

### Unit structs

```rust
struct AlwaysEqaul;

let subject = AlwaysEqual;
```

More on that later.

## Using struct in a program:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn area(dimensions: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    dimensions.width * dimensions.height
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    print!("rect1 is {:#?}", rect1);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}

```

`#[derive(Debug)] `
let's us opt in to pretty print the struct, using: `{:?} and {:#?}`

Another way to print out a value using the Debug format is to use the `dbg!` macro, which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed to println which takes a ref), prints the file and line number of where that dbg! macro call occurs in the code along with the resultant value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.

> Note - dbg! prints to the stderr and println! prints to the stdout.

Using dbg!:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn area(dimensions: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    dimensions.width * dimensions.height
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };
    print!("rect1 is {:#?}", rect1);
    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}
```

output:

```zsh
❯ cargo run
[src/main.rs:14:16] 30 * scale = 60
rect1 is Rectangle {
    width: 60,
    height: 50,
}
The area of the rectangle is 3000 square pixels.
```

## Method Syntax

Methods are similar to functions, we declare them using the `fn` keyword. Unlike functions, methods are define within the context of a struct (or enum or trait) and their first parameter is always `self`.

#### Defining Methods

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };
    println!("rect area: {}", rect1.area());
}

```

Everything in the `impl` block will be associated with the `Rectangle` type. Notice we use (`&self`) as the first and in this case the only parameter. This param refers to the Rectangle instance that was instantiated, in the above case its `rect1`. the `&` indicates that this method borrows the `Self` instance

The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to providing method syntax and not having to repeat the type of `self` in every signature, is for organization. We've put all the things we can do with an instance of a type in one `impl` block rather than making future users of our code search for capabilities of `Rectangle` in various places.

> Note we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the struct's fields.

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn width(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width
    }
}
```

Often, but not always, when we give methods with same name as a field we want it to only return the value, this methods are called `getters`. They are useful because you can make the field private but the method public, and thus enable read only access to that field.

Lets define a new method that returns true if a self can hold another rectangle inside it or false otherwise:

```rust
    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
     // takes immutable borrow of another rectangle
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }

	// calling the method:
	rect1.can_hold(&rect2)
```

> All functions inside an `impl` block are called _associated functions_

We have already used an assoicated function that is not a method (doesn't take self) : `String::from("hello")`

Usually this functions are used as constructors that will return a new instance of the struct. for example:

```rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}

let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
```

The Self keyword in the return type and the body are an aliases for type of the imple block, in this case Rectangle.

> Each struct is allowed to have multiple `impl` blocks.
> There is no reason to separate them but it is a valid syntax.
